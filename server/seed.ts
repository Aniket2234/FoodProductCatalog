In the calm and peaceful countryside where we harvest our honey, bees gather sweet nectar from lavender and rosemary or groves of orange to harvest the sweet nectar from the blossoms. As a result, you'll experience some of those notes in Forever Bee Honey, alongside essence of sacred spice. The flavors are so layered and complex, you'll discover something new to love every time you taste it. Honeybees are incredibly productive.

The star of the show is the Garcinia cambogia fruit, which contains hydroxycitric acid (HCA). This compound has been shown to temporarily inhibit the body's conversion of carbohydrates into fats. The potent Garcinia extract used in Forever Garcinia Plus™ contains high levels of this important compound. Because Garcinia helps inhibit fat production, the body leans toward burning existing fat stores, which aids in weight loss when combined with a sensible diet and exercise program. This incredible fruit has also been shown to help reduce cravings as a natural appetite suppressant. Researchers in the 1960s discovered the Garcinia fruit had compounds that could impact metabolism by inhibiting the enzyme that converts calories into fat. Garcinia is also caffeine free, so you can take this supplement without those caffeine jitters! To complement Garcinia, we added chromium picolinate. If your body is deficient of this important mineral, it could cause fatigue and excess fat production. You work hard to eat right and exercise.
