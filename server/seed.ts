In the calm and peaceful countryside where we harvest our honey, bees gather sweet nectar from lavender and rosemary or groves of orange to harvest the sweet nectar from the blossoms. As a result, you'll experience some of those notes in Forever Bee Honey, alongside essence of sacred spice. The flavors are so layered and complex, you'll discover something new to love every time you taste it. Honeybees are incredibly productive.

The star of the show is the Garcinia cambogia fruit, which contains hydroxycitric acid (HCA). This compound has been shown to temporarily inhibit the body's conversion of carbohydrates into fats. The potent Garcinia extract used in Forever Garcinia Plus™ contains high levels of this important compound. Because Garcinia helps inhibit fat production, the body leans toward burning existing fat stores, which aids in weight loss when combined with a sensible diet and exercise program. This incredible fruit has also been shown to help reduce cravings as a natural appetite suppressant. Researchers in the 1960s discovered the Garcinia fruit had compounds that could impact metabolism by inhibiting the enzyme that converts calories into fat. Garcinia is also caffeine free, so you can take this supplement without those caffeine jitters! To complement Garcinia, we added chromium picolinate. If your body is deficient of this important mineral, it could cause fatigue and excess fat production. You work hard to eat right and exercise.

This rich combination of stabilized aloe vera gel, soluble collagen and alpha-hydroxy acids, fortified with vitamins A and E, is such vital to healthy skin. Vitamin E is a powerful antioxidant, while vitamin A helps in the maintenance of healthy skin and is known as the cell renewal vitamin for its effect on skin conditions. Alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) come from natural plant sources and are also called fruit acids. Together, these fruit acids are exfoliants that loosen dead cells from the skin's surface by dissolving the natural glue-like substances and releasing dead skin cells. These cells create a barrier to moisturizing creams, so getting rid of dead cells evenly means that fresher cells are exposed in the skin's renewal process. As the skin renewal process takes place, you'll experience the full benefits of R3 Factor™ in as little as 21 days. Fruit acid creams have been called the most important skincare agents of the decade. By combining AHAs with soothing aloe, R3 Factor Skin Defense Creme provides a first line of defense in fighting the harsh effects of time to preserve your skin's youthful glow.",

Whether you're heading to the surfboard or heading out for a day at the park, Aloe Sunscreen has your whole family covered. With Aloe Sunscreen, you can go anywhere the sun is shining thanks to your skin's SPF 30 protection that blocks against UVA and UVB rays. UVA rays make up 95% of the radiation that reaches Earth. These rays penetrate the skin more deeply and damage skin's DNA, playing a key role in the aging process and the formation of wrinkles. UVB rays are more damaging to the skin's outer layers and cause more damage than UVA in some cases. They are the primary cause of skin reddening and sunburn. Aloe Sunscreen features a breakthrough blend that includes natural non-nanosized zinc oxide with advanced coating technology. It applies easily, offers superior sun protection without feeling sticky or leaving residue behind. But it isn't just advanced sun blocking technology that makes Aloe Sunscreen such a powerful product. Pure aloe vera from Forever's own fields nourishes the skin, locks in moisture and soothes. Only the highest quality inner leaf gel is used to comfort and defend your skin. We've ramped up the skin-shielding power even further with vitamin E, which combats free radical damage, softens and penetrates deeper for greater moisturization. Aloe Sunscreen is water resistant for 80 minutes. Get the full protective effect by applying generously and every 2 hours when you're out in the sun. Whether you're climbing high toward a mountaintop or enjoying a relaxing weekend cookout, rest assured you can soak in the sun with confidence knowing the power of Aloe Sunscreen is keeping your whole family protected.",

The juice has lived through this history fueled by vitamin C, known to strengthen skin's barrier and limit free radical damage and change for thousands of years.

Mild, moisturizing and milky, this cleanser uses hypoallergenic coco fatty acids to suspend your skin's oils, so they can be carefully and gently washed away from your skin – leaving your face soft to the touch without feeling dry. A key characteristic of youthful skin is being well hydrated and healthy. The age-minimizing cleanser assists your skin's barrier function to fight against tightness and dryness. Bountiful amounts of linoleic acid and vitamin E, found in sunflower seed oil, support skin's lipids and help break down dirt and debris.

    description: "Fast-acting, easy-to-use power. Aloe First™ is a perfect addition to your first aid kit or medicine cabinet. This exclusive skin soothing formula is made using stabilized aloe vera gel from our farms. Aloe vera gel comes in a fast-absorbing spray. Aloe First™ also contains bee propolis and a proprietary blend of eleven powerful plant extracts. Of course, aloe vera is the primary and most powerful ingredient for a reason. For centuries, aloe vera has been used to help soothe minor burns and provide a sense of relief to irritated skin. We added bee propolis to Aloe First™ because it elevates the natural soothing and cleansing properties of aloe. Because Forever operates its own fields, we control every aspect of aloe vera production. That means every leaf is hand-filleted to ensure only the purest, highest quality aloe vera makes its way into Forever's Aloe First™. The combination of aloe and botanical extracts make this a wonderfully soothing mist for use on minor cuts, scrapes, burns and sunburn. The pH-balanced spray is easy to apply and gets to work fast! As an added benefit, Aloe First™ is also great for use on your hair. It provides a great barrier between your hair and the elements. Make sure you always have a bottle of this versatile spray around to experience the fast-acting soothing power of aloe vera when you need it!",
